## Run the Project (React + Vite)

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm 9 or higher (bundled with Node)

### 1) Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2) Start the dev server
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start Vite and print a local URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

### 3) Build for production
```bash
npm run build
```
Outputs static assets to the `dist/` directory.

### 4) Preview the production build
```bash
npm run preview
```
Serves the contents of `dist/` locally.

### Linting and formatting
```bash
npm run lint        # run ESLint
npm run format      # format with Prettier
npm run format:check
```

### Notes
- This project uses React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and several UI/util libraries. See `package.json` for versions and scripts.
